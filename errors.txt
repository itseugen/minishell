1. no output if command doesnt exist -> fix in executor
2. segfault on empty input -> segfaults in executor
3. segfault on CTRL + D -> fix with signaling in exit function (see 5.)
4. /bin/ls doesn't work -> fix in executor (dont search for path if path is given)
	if (ft_strchr(cmd[0], '/') != NULL)
		path = cmd[0];
	else
		path = get_cmd_path(cmd[0], envp);
	this could fix it depending on your executor
5. exit fails (see 3.)
6. echo doesnt remove quotes (it works with my basic executor) -> wrong parsing to builtin echo?
7. /bin/pwd doesn't work anymore (fix see 4.)
8. cd doesnt work anymore -> I'll try to fix it
	Edit: After trying just the command after lexer and ft_split_minishell
	it seems to work -> either it goes wrong in the parser, the executor or the fix_tokens
	My first thought is, that the builtins are called in a wrong way
9. /usr/bin/env doesnt work (fix see 4.)
10. just one space as input fails in fix tokens
11. Here_doc doesnt work
12. < testcmds.txt cat segfaults in red_maker
12.1 All < segfault
13. input with a space before a redirect symbol segfaults in fix_tokens
14. >> doesnt work
15. on Ctrl + C sometimes a second prompt appears (see cat or wc on their own)
16. l"s" -"l"a doesn't work (it works with ft_split_minishell and remove_quotes which you don't use)
	This issue extends to everything else ("pwd" also doesn't work, but it should)
	remove quotes accordingly before executing
	"l"'s' should also work p. e.
