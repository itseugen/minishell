1. no output if command doesnt exist -> fix in executor
2. segfault on empty input -> segfaults in executor
3. segfault on CTRL + D -> fix with signaling in exit function (see 5.)
4. /bin/ls doesn't work -> fix in executor (dont search for path if path is given)
	if (ft_strchr(cmd[0], '/') != NULL)
		path = cmd[0];
	else
		path = get_cmd_path(cmd[0], envp);
	this could fix it depending on your executor
5. exit fails (see 3.)
6. echo doesnt remove quotes (it works with my basic executor) -> wrong parsing to builtin echo?
7. /bin/pwd doesn't work anymore (fix see 4.)
8. cd doesnt work anymore -> I'll try to fix it
	Edit: After trying just the command after lexer and ft_split_minishell
	it seems to work -> either it goes wrong in the parser, the executor or the fix_tokens
	My first thought is, that the builtins are called in a wrong way
9. /usr/bin/env doesnt work (fix see 4.)
10. just one space as input fails in fix tokens
